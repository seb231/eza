A short script to deploy to AWS to monitor the total number of patrons and Patreon value for [Easy Allies](https://easyallies.com/) and the video content delivered.

# To Do
1. Set up continous run with a loop and waiting phase (24hrs?) - use Airflow?
2. Store and append results somewhere
3. Deliver results somehow (email?)
4. Better name
5. Record views and likes of videos
6. Do something with video duration?
